# Chamelii App

This is a template web app edited to suit the needs of the client.
We are using a template to facilitate rapid development and focus on back-end functional work.
This is so we can give the client an insight into what the app could look like, and allow us to
quickly work on API's and other back-end features to build a working prototype, without getting
bogged down by having to create webpages etc.

We are using this template in accordance with the MIT licence outlined in the code and do not
intend on using it for deployment, unless the client wants to purchase a licence for the
app template to be used outside the scope of development.

Culture Club - Chamelii

The dev branch is currently the most complete in terms of functionality and UI experience.
